            <p class="mt-2 text-lg text-stone-600 max-w-3xl mx-auto">The Event Mate module transforms the often solitary acts of gardening and cooking into collaborative and communal experiences. It provides tools to streamline the planning and execution of social gatherings, from intimate dinner parties to large group meals,addressing key pain points for hosts and fostering a sense of community around food.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-stone-900">4.1. Seamless Social & Event Planning</h2>
                    <p class="mb-6 text-stone-700">This module integrates powerful event management features directly into the FSC ecosystem, leveraging the platform's existing data on recipes and inventory.</p>
                    <div class="space-y-4">
                        <p><strong>Integrated Event Management:</strong> The Event Mate willfunction as a specialized planning tool, seamlessly integrating with the user's native calendar and contact Iist.It will manage the entire event lifecycle, from sending invitations and tracking RSVPs to serving as a central communication hub for allevent-related information.This functionality mirrors the user-friendly approach of modern platforms ike Partiful and TopEvent, but with a deep focus on food-centric gatherings.</p>
                        <p><strong>Guest Profile & Dietary Restriction Management:</strong> A critical and high-value feature is the automated management of guest dietary needs. When a host creates an event, the system generates a digital invitation with alink to a simple, user-friendly form where guests can specify their dietary restrictions and allergies.This form will use a combination of checkboxes for common requirements (e.g. vegetarian, gluten-free,dairy-free, nut allergy)and free-text fields for guests to provide specific details,including the severity of their allergies. This information is then automatically aggregated into a master guest list within the event dashboard. The host and any collaborators can view this list, which can be color-coded or tagged for easy reference during menu planning and food preparation. This automated collection and organization process solves a major, high-anxiety pain point for anyone who has ever hosted a group meal.</p>
                        <p><strong>Menu Planning & Validation:</strong> The host can build the event menu directly within the app, selecting recipes from their personal collction or generating new ones with the Culinary Al. The system's most powerful feature here is its ability to cross-reference the planned menu against the aggregated guest dietary data.The Al will automatically flag any potential conflicts, issuing clear warnings such as, "This recipe contains peanuts,and Guest X has a severe peanut allergy". This proactive validation is a key safety and inclusivity feature that provides immense peace of mind for the host.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-stone-900">4.2. Collaborative Culinary Execution</h2>
                    <p class="mb-6 text-stone-700">Event Mate extends beyond planning to facilitate the collaborative preparation of food, whether for a potluck or a shared cooking session.</p>
                    <div class="space-y-4">
                        <p><strong>Multi-Person Task Coordination:</strong> For events involving shared cooking responsibilities, the host can break down complex recipes into individual tasks (e.g., "chop vegetables," "prepare the marinade," "assemble the dish"). These tasks can then be assigned to different guests or collaborators, who can view their assignments and check them off in a shared digital workspace. This functionality, inspired by professional catering software like Planning Pod,brings a new level of organization to group cooking.</p>
                        <p><strong>Shared Shopping Lists:</strong> Once a menu is finalized, the system generates a consolidated shopping list. This list is automatically cross-referenced with the host's smart pantry inventory, removing any items that are already on hand.The final list can then be shared with multiple users. Collaborators can claim specific items to purchase and check them off in real-time, a feature that prevents duplicate buys and ensures all necessary ingredients are procured.This mirrors the core functionality of best-in-class collaborative shopping apps like AnyList.</p>
                        <p><strong>Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC) for Privacy:</strong> To address privacy concerns in collaborative scenarios,the platform can offer an advanced feature utizing Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC). This cryptographic technique allows for joint computation on private data without revealing that data to the other parties. For example, a group could generate a combined shopping list of only the missing items without any individual having to share their entire pantry inventory with the group or a central server. While computationally intensive, offering SMPC as a premium feature would be a groundbreaking diferentiator for a consumer app,demonstrating a profound commitment to user privacy and trust.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-stone-900">4.3. Algorithmic Recipe Scaling</h2>
                    <p class="mb-6 text-stone-700">Preparing a recipe for a large group requires more than simple multiplication. The Event Mate willincorporate an intelligent scaling algorithm to ensure consistent and successful results.</p>
                    <div class="space-y-4">
                        <p><strong>Calculating the Conversion Factor:</strong> The system willbegin with the standard recipe conversion formula: (New Servings / Original Servings) = Conversion Factor. Allingredient quantities in the selected recipe will be multiplied by this factor to generate a baseline scaled recipe.</p>
                        <p><strong>Intelligent Ingredient Adjustments:</strong> The Al will apply a more nuanced scaling model that adjusts certain ingredients non-linearly. Spices,salt, herbs,and leavening agents often have a more potent effect in larger batches.The algorithm willstart by scaling these ingredients to only $7 5 - 8 0 \%$ of the calculated amount and wil l prompt the user to taste and adjust during the final stages of cooking, preventing an overly seasoned or unbalanced dish.</p>
                        <p><strong>Adapting for Equipment and Time:</strong> The Al will also provide crucial logistical guidance for scaled-up recipes. This includes recommending the use of larger pots and pans,adjusting cooking times (a general rule of thumb is a $10 - 1 5 \%$ increase for every doubling of the batch size),and providing warnings about changes in heat distribution and liquid evaporation rates in larger vessels. For very large groups, the system may suggest batch-cooking certain components separately and combining them at the end to ensure even cooking.This transforms the app from a simple calculator into a genuine culinary assistant for large-scale cooking.</p>

                    <p class="text-stone-700">The introduction of the Event Mate fundamentally shifts the platform from a personal utility to a social network centered on food. This creates a powerful network effect; each event planned is an opportunity to introduce new users to the ecosystem, fostering organic, community-led growth.</p>
